/* 
* Async *
-> Async and Await in JavaScript is used to simplify handling asynchronous operations using promises.
-> Async functions always return promise.f a value is returned that is not a promise, JavaScript automatically 
   wraps it in a resolved promise.

* Await *
-> await used to wait for a promise to resolve.
-> it can only be used within async block.
-> await makes the code wait until promise returns result.

* throw *
=> throw used to reject the function.

=> Syntax :
        => throw 'error-message'
        => throw new Error('error-message')
