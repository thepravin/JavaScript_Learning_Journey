/* 
You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes. Character classes allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square ([ and ]) brackets.

For example, you want to match bag, big, and bug but not bog. You can create the regex /b[aiu]g/ to do this. The [aiu] is the character class that will only match the characters a, i, or u.

*/

let bigStr = "big";
let bagStr = "bag";
let bugStr = "bug";
let bogStr = "bog";
let bgRegex = /b[aiu]g/;
bigStr.match(bgRegex);//big
bagStr.match(bgRegex);//bag
bugStr.match(bgRegex);//bug
bogStr.match(bgRegex);// null


//* Question :
/* 
Use a character class with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in your regex vowelRegex to find all the vowels in the string quoteSample.

Note: Be sure to match both upper- and lowercase vowels.

let quoteSample = "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.";
let vowelRegex = /[aeiou]/ig; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(vowelRegex); // Change this line
