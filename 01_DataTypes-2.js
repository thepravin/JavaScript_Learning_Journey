    Non Premitive

    -> Ther are only one type of non primitive data type that
        is called "Object"
    
        => Objects divided into 3 categories.
            1) Object Literals
            2) Arrays
            3) Functions

    -> In non-premitive data type, at time of comparision here only address will compare rither than vlaue.
    -> If you access key not defind in object then it give "undefine"
*/

/*

NOTE => 

    if we create any non prmitive data-type use 'const'.
    -> const means you can't change value, but here

    eg. =>
        const user = {firstName : 'pravin'};
        firstName = 'ganesh'

    -> here firstName change with ganesh beacuse we only modify or update allready present value. 
    -> if we assign new object to const object then , address of old object is change and it not allowed with const.
    -> in const we can't reassine datatype with new datatype.

    user = user2; // give error
