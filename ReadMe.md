Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Journey repository!

## About

I've recently started learning JavaScript, and as I discover new concepts and techniques, I practice by coding examples and exercises. This repository is where I document my progress by pushing code related to various JavaScript concepts. 

## Repository Structure
