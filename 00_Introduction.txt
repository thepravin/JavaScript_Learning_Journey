# What Does defer Do?
When you add defer to a <script> tag, it tells the browser to load the script in the background while the rest of the page is loading.
The script will only run after the HTML is fully loaded and parsed. This helps ensure that the JavaScript can safely interact with all the elements on the page.

#If You Don’t Use defer
If you don’t use defer, the browser will stop loading the page to run the script as soon as it reaches the <script> tag.

#This can lead to two problems:
Slower Page Load: The page may take longer to display because it pauses to run the script.
Errors: If your script tries to access elements that haven’t loaded yet, it might not work properly or can cause errors.
